NetworkObjects is a **#PureSwift** backend. This framework compiles for OS X, iOS and Linux and serves as the foundation for building powerful Swift servers. Powered by [SwiftFoundation](https://github.com/PureSwift/SwiftFoundation) and [CoreModel](https://github.com/PureSwift/CoreModel), the framework comes with server and client classes which abstract away advanced networking code.
